"""Build the creative pole's sprite: the large pole's own art, recoloured pink.

The creative pole is a dev tool that wears the large pole's footprint. A tool whose whole job is "place it, place a machine, read Jade" has to be *visibly* not the block
it imitates: one left behind in a test world otherwise powers a factory that looks self-sufficient,
and nothing in the world says which of the two poles is doing it. Pink is the convention for a
creative-only block, so pink it is.

**Derived rather than drawn.** The large pole's sprite is the subject and this is a recolour of it,
so that the large pole's sprite, redrawn, carries its shading, its silhouette and its pixel count
straight through to the creative pole instead of leaving a stale hand-painted copy nobody re-derives. Each
pixel keeps its own brightness and is re-lit in {CREATIVE_PINK:#08x}: the ramp, and therefore the
shading, is the large pole's.

Run after the large pole's texture changes:

    scripts/build-creative-pole-texture.py

`--check` re-derives and diffs, like every other generator here. No PIL: the codec below is a
minimal 8-bit reader and an RGBA writer, which is the trade every PNG generator here makes -- a
dependency for one crop is not worth a wheel in the toolchain.
