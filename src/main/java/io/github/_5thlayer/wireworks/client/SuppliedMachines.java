/**
 * Which machines a pole reaches, for the Supply Area Square to outline (ADR 0005, ADR 0009),
 * cached.
 *
 * <p>The answer is {@link SupplyAreaScan}'s -- the same scan the pole runs to build its network, so
 * the outlines cannot claim a machine the network would not feed, or miss one it would.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is cached rather than asked per frame</h2>
 *
 * <p>A large pole's area is 18x18x5 = 1620 blocks and the scan is a capability lookup per block.
 * That is the cost the pole's own scan already refuses to pay every tick, and a renderer pays it
 * sixty times a second rather than twenty. So the same answer is kept for
 * {@link #RESCAN_INTERVAL} -- the pole's own interval, for the pole's own reason: machines do not
 * appear and vanish every tick, and a newly placed one waits at most two seconds to be outlined.
 *
 * <p>The cache holds one entry, because only one square is ever drawn in a frame. A held pole that
 * would extend a column draws no square from the hand (the column's own renderer draws it), a pole
 * aimed at a wrong-tier pole is refused, and a placed pole draws only while looked at -- so the two
 * call sites cannot both want a different base at once. If that ever stops being true this becomes
 * a thrashing single-entry cache rather than a wrong one.
