/**
 * The Supply Area Box (ADR 0005): a pole's supply area drawn as the volume it covers, the third thing
 * the Placement Preview shows after the translucent block (Groundworks ADR 0001 and 0002) and the
 * wires the pole would add ({@link PreviewWires}).
 *
 * <p>Minecraft is three dimensional and the area is a three dimensional region, so the box is drawn as
 * one: a surface draped over the terrain would show holes where the area does not stop.
 *
 * <h2>One builder, two call sites</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #offsets} is the whole geometry, and it is a function of the tier alone -- nothing here
 * reads the world. The held item's preview and the placed pole's renderer both draw what it
 * returns, so they cannot disagree about where the area is, which is the placement plan's rule
 * applied to the overlay. The bounds come from {@link SupplyArea#bounds}: the substation's
 * even-sided area takes its extra block on the negative side, and a renderer that centred the box
 * instead would be wrong by half a block on the one tier where it shows.
 *
 * <h2>The machines are outlined too</h2>
 *
 * <p>The box says where the footprint lands, and a player reading it wants to know which machines are
 * inside -- a question no box shape can answer, because membership depends on the band and the box
 * has no face at a machine's height. So every block the pole reaches is outlined in the same yellow
 * ({@link SuppliedMachines}). The outlines are the scan's own answer, not a capability sweep, so
 * they agree with the network by construction rather than by coincidence.
 *
 * <h2>Edges only, and drawn through terrain</h2>
 *
 * <p>No fill. The player is almost always <em>inside</em> the volume -- the band is two blocks
 * either way and they stand on the ground the pole does -- so a fill would be a full-screen colour
 * wash over exactly the machines being positioned, and an 18-wide substation seen from outside
 * would be a wall between the player and their own base. Vanilla draws the structure block's
 * bounding box as edges only at the same scale, for the same reason.
 *
 * <p>The edges ignore depth. The box's lower edges sit two blocks below the base, so on flat ground
 * they are inside the terrain; depth-tested, the box reads as an open-bottomed cage and the ground
 * extent -- the thing the overlay exists to show -- is the part that goes missing. No stock line
 * type passes depth unconditionally, so {@link #PIPELINE} is vanilla's own {@code LINES_SNIPPET}
 * with {@link CompareOp#ALWAYS_PASS} and no depth write. It costs nothing extra: the same twelve
 * segments and the same arithmetic, with the test off.
