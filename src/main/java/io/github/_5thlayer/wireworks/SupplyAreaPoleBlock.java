/**
 * A Factorio electric pole (FactoryWorks ADR-0036, FactoryWorks ADR-0062): it supplies every machine standing in its area, and
 * it links to every pole within wire reach into one Electric Network.
 *
 * <p>The network is recomputed from the poles standing rather than stored -- no propagation, no
 * topology persisted across chunk unloads. {@link ElectricNetworks} has the why.
 *
 * <p>One class serves all three tiers; they differ by the {@link PoleTier} handed to the
 * constructor and by nothing else.
 *
 * <h2>The pole is a column</h2>
 *
 * <p>A pole stands as tall as the player builds it, up to {@link PoleColumn#MAX_SEGMENTS}, and the
 * supply area is measured at the base whatever the height. {@link PoleColumn} has the why. This
 * class owns the two world-facing consequences: extending a column and breaking one.
