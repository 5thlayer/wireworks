/**
 * How a pole splits a shortfall across the machines in its area.
 *
 * <p>First-come-first-served would be wrong in a way the player cannot see or plan around: the
 * machines the scan happens to reach first would run and the rest would starve, permanently, on an
 * iteration order that is an implementation detail of {@link SupplyArea#forEachOffset}. Factorio
 * shares a shortfall out instead, and so does this.
 *
 * <p>Water-filling: everyone gets an equal cut, and a machine whose demand is below that cut takes
 * only what it asked for and its spare goes back into the pot for the machines that can still use
 * it. Repeat until the pot is empty or every demand is met.
 *
 * <p>Pure: no Minecraft types.
