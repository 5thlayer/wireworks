/**
 * A pole: a position in an Electric Network and a supply area whose contents it keeps sorted.
 *
 * <h2>The pole moves no energy itself</h2>
 *
 * <p>FactoryWorks ADR-0062 makes the network the carrier. A pole reports itself to {@link ElectricNetworks}
 * every tick and rescans its area now and then; the network, once per level tick, settles every
 * pole wired into it in one set of books. A pole holds no buffer and has no energy face: nothing feeds
 * it, because generators are pulled from where they stand.
 *
 * <h2>Roles are decided by tag</h2>
 *
 * <p>Anything in the area answering {@link Capabilities.Energy#BLOCK} is a consumer unless its
 * block is tagged {@link WireworksTags#GENERATORS} or {@link WireworksTags#ACCUMULATORS}. The face alone cannot decide it: a
 * machine whose face allows extraction would otherwise be drained as a generator.
 *
 * <p>The tag read is the energy owner's, not the block's: {@link SupplyScan} resolves a hull block to
 * its controller and a slave engine to its master first, and keeps each owner once (factoryworks#292).
 *
 * <h2>Why the lists are cached</h2>
 *
 * <p>A substation's area is 18x18x5 = 1620 blocks. A capability lookup per block per tick is not
 * affordable, and it is also pointless: machines do not appear and vanish every tick. The area is
 * rescanned on {@link #RESCAN_INTERVAL}, so a newly placed machine waits at most two seconds.
