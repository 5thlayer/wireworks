 * Box outlines (ADR 0005). There is one of it rather than two: a client that re-derived "which
 * machines are in here" would drift from the server's answer, and the ways it would drift are
 * not obvious. A slave Steam Engine resolves to its master, which may stand outside the area
 * entirely; a machine's hull block answers its controller's face and is never a consumer in its own
 * right. A naive "does this block have an Energy capability" sweep gets both wrong and lights up
 * blocks the network never feeds -- an overlay lying more precisely than before.
 *
 * <p>The rule itself is {@link SupplyScan#classify}, which is Minecraft-free and unit-tested in
 * {@code SupplyScanTest}. This class is only the part that needs a {@link Level}: gathering the
 * positions and asking each one for its owner and its role.
