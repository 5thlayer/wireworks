 * How a pole's area becomes three lists: every block resolved to the energy owner it answers to,
 * each owner kept once, and the owner -- not the block -- given a role (factoryworks#292, FactoryWorks ADR-0062).
 *
 * <p>A block is not a machine. Oritech's Steam Engine is three failures to a scan that files by
 * position: its machine-core hull blocks answer the controller's energy face with an untagged
 * block, so they would be consumers; one engine would be offered and drawn once per block in the
 * area; and a slave, which holds no FE, would be reached while its master stands out of range.
 * Resolving first answers all three at once.
 *
 * <p>Pure: positions are a type parameter, so no Minecraft types.
